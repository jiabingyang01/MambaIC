## :open_book: Abstract
A high-performance image compression algorithm is crucial for real-time information transmission across numerous fields. Despite rapid progress in image compression, computational inefficiency and poor redundancy modeling still pose significant bottlenecks, limiting practical applications. Inspired by the effectiveness of state space models (SSMs) in capturing long-range dependencies, we leverage SSMs to address computational inefficiency in existing methods and improve image compression from multiple perspectives. In this paper, we integrate the advantages of SSMs for better efficiency-performance trade-off and propose an enhanced image compression approach through refined context modeling, which we term MambaIC. Specifically, we explore context modeling to adaptively refine the representation of hidden states. Additionally, we introduce window-based local attention into channel-spatial entropy modeling to reduce potential spatial redundancy during compression, thereby increasing efficiency. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, particularly for high-resolution image compression.

###

## Training 
We train the model with our wildfire dataset (11k), you can also try to train the model on larger datasets like OpenImages dataset (first 400K images)
```
bash train.sh
```
Remember to replace *save-path*, *train-dataname* and *test-dataname* in the script with your own path.

## Evaluation
```
bash eval.sh
```
Set your own test data and checkpoint by parameter *--data* and *--checkpoint*.

## Pretrained Models
We provide a re-implementation of $\lambda$ 0.008 [0.008checkpoint_best.pth.tar](https://huggingface.co/AuroraZengfh/MambaIC) for quick evaluation. Performance may vary slightly due to hardware and code differences.

## Experimental Results

<!-- ## Note
1. This is not the exact original code and is a re-implementation of our CVPR 2025 paper. But the core code and experimental results are almost the same, with slight difference and acceptable experimental deviation.

2. This is to make a clear clarification that, unlike previous works that use $\times$ 12.7 larger OpenImages (400k) as training dataset, we use Flickr30k (30k), which may cause some misunderstandings in BD-rate between original papers and our paper.  -->
